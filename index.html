            <h3 class="post-date">05/18/21</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="post">Just a couple months ago youtube started recommending me videos with names like weirdcore playlist and traumacore/glitchcore playlist. The content of each video was just a few songs played over a looping animation or some sort of animation that evolved over time like a changing color filter. Each playlist had similar songs and usually differed in just 4 or 5 of their song choices. Some recurring artists would include Mac Demarco, Sewerslvt, Sitcom, Kero Kero Bonito, Blank Banshee and a few others. The visuals accompanying any given video were usually simple and contained anime or hello kitty iconography. Stagnant visuals were a <i>faux pas</i> so to speak, it was paramount to keep the viewer entertained but not overstimulated. Even if it was just the color filter changing or the intensity of an after effects slider, it showed at least the relics of a clear thought and understanding of the digital medium. What I'm trying to say is that most of these videos had a lot in common, in a good way. I think it showed an understanding of the medium in which they presented themselves.<br><br>
            The name of the videos themselves told me that people resonated emotionally with this kind of broken and unstable motif. A glitch in itself refers to the broken nature of a thing or more specifically it's unstable inner workings, so its easy to make the mental connection between a glitch and something like mental trauma that can leave one feeling unstable or internally like there is something wrong. Everyday it's becoming more apparant that a generation of kids who were raised by the internet and had absent parents are coming of age and they want to create content that they can put out into the world. This desire to connect with people through a small playlist of songs and share common niche interests is part of the community building process as well as naming the community itself. I don't think hyperpop or soundcloud rap could have become as popular as they are without having been named. The name itself doesn't have to be catchy but it needs to exist in order for people to properly categorize their idea of the genre and in order to communicate about the feeling the genre gives them. By naming a thing we give ourselves the ability to compare and contrast it with other ideas.<br><br>
            I think the creation of these playlists is healthy for the overall music scene. It has at least led to me discovering one or two new artists. And this kind of organic exploration/discovery of new music is sort of akin to the tik tok music scene where we've already seen a few people manifest careers for themselves just by being discovered organically through the app, I'm thinking specifically of Pink Pantheress, whom I really quite like. It's really never been a better time to be a musician or curator I think in terms of your ability to reach people. As things only become more interconnected people may crave more generalized curation done by a human being as opposed to individualized curation done by an AI. Because the curation done by the AI will most likely keep you inside a safe bubble where it knows exactly what content you'll enjoy whereas a living breathing person may offer you something different, more jarring, more experimental maybe. And that kind of organic discovery is really the most rewarding for people. Then again I probably would not have even discovered these types of videos if it had not been for the youtube algorithm. Maybe then, like most things in life, it is about finding a balance and creating a feedback system between these two seemingly opposite ends of the spectrum: Algorithm recommendations and organic suggestions, one made by machines, the other by real people.<br><br>
            The names we can give to a genre truly are infinite especially when you consider the multitude of expressions we can concoct just by taking a word and adding -core or -pop to the end or maybe adding tech- and glitch- to the beginning but the names have never really mattered to me. Just the act of discovery is important to me and I'm willing to seek out new ways of discovering things. I wonder whether places like Youtube will continue to be sources for the discovery of new music or if it will become easier with new platforms that may overtake Apple Music and Spotify. Right now it remains to be seen but I can definitely say I hope the recommendations continue lol.

            <h2 class="post-title">The Genre For Everything Else</h2>
            <h3 class="post-date">05/07/21</h3>
            <br>
            <div class="post">For a while now, I‚Äôve wanted to contribute to the music scene. What‚Äôs fascinating is that there are so many ways to be a part of the music scene. Obviously, if you‚Äôre the one making and putting out music you‚Äôre contributing to the zeitgeist that is music and thereby influencing the direction for which future music will be made. But you might not have considered that, whether you‚Äôre making visuals for DJ sets or directing videos or drawing an album cover, you are essentially effecting what is viewed as popular or valuable within the scene, same as the way the actually musician does. Even the critic contributes, in a similar way, to what the scene considers valuable. This thought was partly the inspiration behind my starting to write this. And so I see this writing as a space where I can be a sort of critic. Not that I‚Äôll be judging anything harshly or deeming anything to be bad. I don‚Äôt think there really is bad art except in the case of soulless, corporate art, but I‚Äôll be mostly pointing out things I think deserve more attention. I don‚Äôt know what else I‚Äôm going to write about or even if I‚Äôll have the motivation to keep writing these after a few weeks or possibly months. But I do know that right now it feels like I need to start writing something. Let me first say that I want to keep things casual and almost stream-of-consciousness but I hope to improve more than anything the quality of my writing and my ability to convey ideas. I‚Äôve somehow acquired a miniscule dose of motivation and I need to put it toward something.
            <br><br>
            So here goes.
            <br><br>
            I like to consider music taste as a sort of eq band. It‚Äôs a pretty bad analogy honestly but for now its fine just go with it. Every genre of music lies along the eq band and each genre flows seamless into the next but for each person‚Äôs tastes the frequency volume is turned up or down. So the music scene in general can be broken down into these tiny almost infinitesimal subgenres and we could try to capture one of these genres, focus in, and talk exclusively about that (i.e. MetalSucks within the metal scene and Lyrical Lemonade within the modern rap scene). But I don‚Äôt consider myself a fan of just one genre I‚Äôm more of a fan of anything that is different, new, and challenging. And so, it may be a more difficult task to talk about music in general as opposed to homing in on a specific thing but I‚Äôm going to try anyway. Essentially, I realized that publications, like MetalSucks, Lyrical Lemonade, Pitchfork, Pigeons and Planes, and others, have power within their respective scene because they contribute to what those scenes deem valuable. But what those publications lack is an individualized sense of taste. I think it‚Äôs incredible that these music blogs can have a sway over the music industry and even more incredible that someone like Anthony Fantano can have a very real and direct impact on the scene by giving attention to things that he likes and even interviewing bands that people want to hear more from. Due to the fact that Anthony doesn‚Äôt hide behind a brand name I think it‚Äôs also easier for him to talk honestly with artists during interviews which can be more valuable than a music columnist who asks the same ten questions.<br><br>
            Recently though, I watched <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma_y5TcHMOU">an interview</a> between Anthony Fantano and Kero Kero Bonito where they talked about the advent of a weird genre named "escape room". According to KKB they were, at least partially, progenitors for this new musical genre which includes other acts like Death Grips, Jockstrap, Xiu Xiu, 100 Gecs, The Garden and more. This genre, they claimed was, where the music outside of easy classification seemed to ‚Äúwash up‚Äù. It allowed for such different and sonically diametric sounds to emerge because each artist was uniquely doing their own thing. So how did all these weird acts get thrown together into a new genre together? Due to Spotify's algorithm having so much trouble categorizing these artists, the algorithm sort of puts them all to the side and somehow comes up with its own connections between what these bands are doing. In a sense the AI has showed us that there is some sort of weird connections between what these bands were putting out into the world. 
            <br><br>
            To me it seems to point toward the ability of these bands to push music in new directions making this ‚Äúgenre‚Äù or ‚Äúgrouping‚Äù of artists to be some of the most innovative players in the game, so to speak. It‚Äôs also music that very literally resists mainstream praise. By pushing music in new directions and exploring new possibilities they inherently reject the acceptance of the mainstream. The importance of this, if it isn‚Äôt already evident, is the way in which this exploration breeds musical progress. Without bands putting out strange new albums and musical offerings the music scene would stagnate, and each individual genre of music would remain closed off from one another. Not an ideal situation.
            <br><br>
            So, if musical progress comes from combining already existing genres and alchemizing them into something new, why don‚Äôt we simply aim to do that? Unfortunately, it‚Äôs no small task for an individual to distill the best elements of two genres and then somehow combine those elements into a new rhythm, melody, riff, or sample that eventually becomes an entire song in itself. What would be a lot easier is to train a neural network on what it means to make music of a certain genre, the neural network can then make connections between songs of the same genre and figure out what charactaristics define that genre. Once the neural network can identify the genre of a given song we can then ask the neural network to generate what it thinks a song of a given genre might sound like. This where we can ask the AI to generate a song of the genre metal-country, or goth-polka, or medieval-punk. You can find examples of this kind of work being done with OpenAI Jukebox <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arQvUrIMNc">here</a>. The songs aren't the best and after listening to some of the music the AI generated its pretty clear that these songs weren't created by a human. Although you can see there's definitely evidence of musical ideas, they don't necessarily go anywhere. Some part of me doubt's that there will ever truly be an algorithm that can spit out music equivalent to what a living breathing person can create but nevertheless having algorithms like this can help us to generate our own new ideas.
            <br><br>
            This might just be me, but I think a gigantic part of the creative process is about exploration. And so I think that bands that stray on the side of experimental tend to interest me more. I think they're important to music and important to their respective scenes. And as a lover of music, I appreciate the ability these types of artists have to mangle, rip, and sew different styles of music together. I use those words because the music they make exudes a kind of physicality to it that is beautiful and innocent while at the same time violent and perverse. It should be no secret that I want to create music and art that feels the same way. I think by paying attention to more artists like this, and with the help of AI causing these bands to bubble up to the top, by categorizing them as inherently different, it may become easier to seek out more art like this and to gain inspiration from more people. Honestly, this points to what I think are the two most beautiful things AI can do for us: 1) Help us generate new ideas and connections and 2) Connect us with more people that can inspire us, thereby building larger, healthier communities.<br><br>
